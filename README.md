# IT326-DataMining-Project
This project focuses on uncovering the hidden links between a student's lifestyle and their mental health. Our objective is to build an intelligent system that classifies and predicts depression risks based on real-world metrics like academic pressure and sleep quality. We also utilize clustering to identify student groups sharing similar challenges—such as work-study balance and CGPA—to better understand the root causes of psychological distress.

The core problem is that student depression often remains "silent" and hard to detect amidst academic commitments. We aim to solve this by transforming raw data—such as study hours and financial stress—into proactive indicators. Rather than waiting for symptoms to escalate, our project provides a technical framework to predict risks and identify students in need of early intervention

Our motivation for choosing this project stems from a desire to transform "static data" into a real-world tool for student protection. With the increasing psychological challenges in academic environments, we believe that data mining techniques allow us to look beyond the numbers and understand how financial and academic pressures intertwine to affect a student's stability. We are motivated by the potential for technical solutions to play a humanitarian role in early detection, ultimately fostering a supportive educational environment that prioritizes student
