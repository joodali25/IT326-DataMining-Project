        "The goal of this project is to apply classification and clustering techniques on a real-world student mental health dataset. The classification model aims to predict the depression status of students (Yes/No) based on academic, social, and lifestyle attributes such as age, academic pressure, study satisfaction, sleep duration, dietary habits, financial stress, and family history of mental illness. The clustering model aims to uncover patterns by grouping students with similar characteristics, providing insights into the relationships between various factors associated with student depression.\n",
